OVERVIEW:

Genesis is primarily a framework inspired by Metasploit Framework and the
Social Engineering Toolkit.

INSTALLATION:

You can download the entire repository if you want, but there's another option:

1) Download the file gpm to a directory of your choice

2) Run* gpm as follows:

	a) If you just want to install genesis core:
		bash gpm install core
				or
		bash gpm install

	b) If you want to install everything:
		bash gpm install all

GPM:

gpm acts as a manager for genesis

Usage:
	gpm install [core | all]						Installs genesis core | Installs core and all available modules
	gpm uninstall									Removes genesis entirely
	
	gpm add [<module> | all]						Adds module <module> | Adds all modules
	gpm remove [<module> | all]						Removes module <module> | Removes all modules

	gpm list [all | installed | available]			Lists all modules | Lists installed modules | Lists available modules

	gpm help										Help guide

Watch for updates to gpm, I may add more functionality in the future

*gpm creates an exec script for itself and can be run directly as gpm instead of bash gpm
			
PURPOSE:

Genesis was developed as a malware development platform targeting Windows
operating systems

CREDITING:

Genesis was created by Sleepless, but is heavily inspired by Metasploit, and
any similarities in code beyond the inevitable are purely coincidental

HOWEVER, some of the modules created by Sleepless use techniques created by other
individuals/groups who have posted tutorials of their work online for public usage.
Sleepless has attempted to give credit to the individuals/groups, but does not claim
any ownership of any code or technique that is not sited, except for those
specifically  discussed in the GOALS section below.

CUSTOMIZATION:

Genesis is, at its core, little more than a user interface framework whose
functionality resides almost exclusively in modules. Due to the dynamic
capabilities of modular functionality, Genesis is easy to modify and expand.
For information on module development, see the TUTORIAL section

GOALS:

In researching various malware execution techniques and antivirus bypassing
techniques, various weaknesses were found in both code and techniques. Some of
the functions prebuilt into Genesis are Sleepless's way of addressing some of these
problems.

Some problems found include:
- UAC bypass patches
- IP addressing
- plaintext analysis in code

Many of the prebuilt functions utilize a social engineering approach to fortify
the code:

** The following are techniques Sleepless has not seen in malware tutorials and
assumes are his own work, but if any individual finds an existing tutorial
concerning any of the following used for the specific tasks stated below, they
are to contact Sleepless with a link to the original source so that credit may be
properly given **

MITM phishing tactics including ARP and DNS spoofing
	- DNS redirect/spoof to add legitimacy to plaintext IP addresses

UAC elevation scripts* to counteract UAC patches/legal concerns
	- Victim controlled permissions to malware access

General code fortification through indirection and dynamic development

* Sleepless does not claim to be the original developer of these scripts

TUTORIAL:

Overview: Genesis is Ruby based, and all modules MUST be Ruby scripts for
Genesis to work properly

If another language is needed, the source code and/or the execution thereof
needs to be wrapped within the Ruby script

Example:

<begin ruby>

	def function
		system <<~EOS
			# bash script here
		EOS
	end

<end ruby>

Modules: Modules are packaged as gemfiles whose contents are extracted at runtime

Module scripts MUST contain the following functions:
	
	def mname
		"module name"
	end

	def cmds
		[ "command1", "command2", "command3" ]
	end

	def vars
		[ "var1", "var2", "var3" ]
	end

	def use
		[ ]
	end

	def generate(vars)
		# vars is a hash of variables and their values
	end

For a list of limitations of module configs see PREDEFINED

Note: in order for the custom commands defined in cmds() to execute, their
corresponding functions must be the exact same name as their string
representations

Ex:
	def command1
		
	end

Limitations of module persistence: module scripts do not remain in memory for
long, and have minimal interaction with Genesis' core. If any data beyond
variables and their values need to be stored, the data will need to be stored in a
file and parsed as necessary. Genesis is not capable of doing this itself.

PREDEFINED:

Commands:
	clear
	cls
	load
	unload
	set
	generate (linker function between module and core; how variables stored
		  from "set" are returned to the module)
	configs
	list
	exit

Variables:
	Most flags/options for msfvenom, anything not already defined needs to
	be added manually

Any overlap of the predefined options and the custom module options could
result in unexpected code execution and/or application failure

LEGAL:

Sleepless does not condone or take any responsibility for any
illegitimate/illegal usage of Genesis or its capabilities. Genesis is designed
purely as a tool for experimentation and learning at the user's own risk.
